## Description
This project is a new practical item of my mobile app series that made with some React Navigations and:
 - react native v0.65.1
 - [stack-navigator](https://reactnavigation.org/docs/stack-navigator/) - (to make transitions between screens)
 - [react-navigation/bottom-tabs](https://reactnavigation.org/docs/bottom-tab-navigator/) - (simple tab bar on the bottom to switch screens)
 - [react-navigation/material-bottom-tabs](https://reactnavigation.org/docs/material-bottom-tab-navigator/) - (simple tab bar on the bottom to switch screens for Android)
 - [react-navigation/drawer](https://reactnavigation.org/docs/drawer-based-navigation/) - (common left drawer navigation)
 - [react-native-reanimated-2.3.0-alpha.3](https://docs.swmansion.com/react-native-reanimated/) - (to make transitions between screens)
 - [react-native-elements](https://reactnativeelements.com/) - (UI Toolkit for RN apps)
 - [react-native-vector-icons](https://github.com/oblador/react-native-vector-icons) - (UI buttons and logos)
 - Of course, I used things like components, custom drawer navigator and context API to manage changes in the app.
